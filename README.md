**Modeling the risk of aerosol and droplet SARS-CoV-2 transmission in enclosed spaces**

**Background:** SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to infect persons via airborne transmission and droplet transmission. While models have been used to estimate infection rates in airborne routes, studies have not examined airborne and droplet transmission together. Droplet transmission is dependent on distance from an infected source, while aerosol transmission depends primarily on ventilation factors. Risk of infection is difficult to estimates using existing models as setting conditions vary. A model that encompasses multiple transmission modes is vital for accurate infection risk estimates that take environmental factors into account at room-scale.

**Methods:** A compartment model will be proposed with a beta term extension to consider airborne and droplet transmission in an enclosed space. Two settings are examined, an  airplane based on a real case cluster and a hypothetical office space to understand the model's responsiveness to ventilation rates, distance from infected persons, and room volume.

**Results:** The analysis of flight EK448 revealed that under the conditions considered including room volume, ventilation, and number of people, the R0 is higher in airplane settings and is more sensitive to ventilation rates in airplane settings. These findings suggest aerosol transmission may play a larger role in airplane settings compared to other spaces.

**Conclusions:** The transmission risk can vary between settings even when distance and ventilation rate, the main variables we can control, are the same. The proposed model represents an essential tool to be applied to enclosed spaces and can support public health experts, engineers, and epidemiologists in planning intervention strategies for specific indoor environments.
